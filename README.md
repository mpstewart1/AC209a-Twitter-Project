## AC209a Twitter Bot Detection Project

This repository contains all of the notebooks that were developed for the purpose of detecting bots on Twitter using data science and machine learning techniques, for the AC209a fall semester class at Harvard University.

The notebooks outlined the procedure of data acquisition using the **tweepy** Twitter API library for Python, followed by exploratory data analysis and model development. Natural language processing techniques such as topic modeling and sentiment analysis were also implemented to obtain both tweet-level features user-level features. The machine learning techniques utilized in this study were:

- Logistic Regression
- LDA/QDA
- Random Forest
- Boosting
- K Nearest Neighbors
- Feed Forward Artificial Neural Network
- Support Vector Machines
- Stacking (Meta Ensembling)
- Blended Ensemble

These models are compared and the most informative features to determine whether a particular Twitter account is a bot or a legitimate user are discussed. A discussion is also given which aims to answer the following question, *How do bots and legitimate users differ in their discussion of political topics?*
